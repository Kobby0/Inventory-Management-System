DETAILS
-----------------
The goal of Shoprite Ghana Limited's inventory management system is to make it easier for admins and attendants to complete their tasks.
 While attendants can make purchases and print receipts, the administrator can add attendants and view sales, products, and categories.
It is made to expedite and simplify work. As long as their credentials are valid, attendees can log out and back in at any moment. 
Every action is documented in a database that only the administrator may access. 
The administrator may also add users, view sales, add products, and alter the category to which they belong. 
When the day's operations are complete, records are kept that include the date, the attendant's name, and the amount of sales.
